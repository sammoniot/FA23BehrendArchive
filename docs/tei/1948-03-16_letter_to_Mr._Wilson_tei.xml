            occupations</p>
         <p style="question">3. Of your employees in technical occupations how many are Engineers with a college
            degree in engineering or the equivalent?</p>
         <p style="question">4. Of your employees in technical occupations how many are in occupations auxiliary to
            engineering such as draftsman,testers,inspectors, technicians and similar categories
            which ordinarily acquire these so-called technical Institute type of preparation that is
            employees in the same areas between the skilled crafts and engineering</p>
         <p style="question">5. Of the engineers employed by your organization, what percentage or graduates from
            Pennsylvania engineering colleges?</p>
         <p style="question">6. Do you feel that the engineering output of Pennsylvania colleges should be increased
            if so should additional engineering College facilities be made available by increasing
            the facilities of the present institutions,</p>
