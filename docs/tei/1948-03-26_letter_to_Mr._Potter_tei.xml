         <p>Dr. A.A. Potter, Dean of Engineering</p>
         <p>Purdue University</p>
         <p>Lafayette,Indiana</p>
         <p>Dear Dr Potter:--</p>
         <p>in reply to your March 16th 1948 letter addressed to Mr. G. W. Wilson it is apparent
            that you desire accurate information as it might apply to our company as a whole
            therefore since this information is directly available through the office of Mr. M.M.
            Boring at Schenectady your inquiry is being forwarded to him for reply.</p>
         <p>For your information, Pennsylvania State College is at present being petitioned to
            establish an undergraduate Center in Erie PA to provide the initial to use of accredited
            college study to those interested in engineering, science and agriculture. Despite
            opposition voiced by three local colleges namely Mercyhurst, and Villa Maria (girls
            college),and Gannon college (offering Liberal Arts courses), it has been determined
            through a carefully conducted survey in cooperation with Penn State College Extension
            Services that there is a definite need for such a Center in this area we understand that
            the matter is to be discussed with the Penn State Trustees during the coming week, and
            for the benefit of this largely Industrial community, we trust that a favorable decision
            to establish that you sent to you will be made.</p>
         <p>It would be far preferable to the people of this community as a whole to establish such
            a branch of Penn State College which is thoroly competent to provide high standard
            instruction in these specialized subjects, rather than an attempt to add an engineering
            curriculum to the college above-mentioned.</p>
         <p>Fall particularly may be secured from Mr. David E. Pugh of Pennsylvania State College who
            has spent considerable time in this area studying the entire situation.</p>
         <p>Yours very truly,</p>
         <p>(Signed) R.C.Reed</p>
         <p>supervisor of personnel</p>
