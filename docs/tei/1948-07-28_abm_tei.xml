         <p><persName type="attended">Mr. Nick</persName> asked the Secretary to mail the minutes of all future meetings to each member
            of the Board.</p>
         <p><persName type="attended">Mr. Nick</persName> asked <persName type="attended">Mr. Ferguson</persName>,<affiliation>Administrative Head</affiliation>,for a resume of the general situation at
            the <placeName type="education">Behrend Center</placeName>.<persName type="attended">Mr. Ferguson</persName> covered the construction work to date and stated that
            the work is ahead of scheduele. <persName type="attended">Mr. Ferguson</persName> also brought the <orgName type="education">Advisory Board</orgName> members
            up-to-date on the staff members appointed.</p>
         <p>On the matter of publicity,<persName type="attended">Mr.Ferguson</persName> commended the action of some companies in
            publicizing <placeName type="education">Behrend College</placeName> in their company publications. He also stated that both of
            the local newspapers have been very cooperative.He talked briefly about concerning the
            <placeName type="education">Daytime technical Institute</placeName> and <placeName type="education">Evening Technical Institute</placeName> and cautioned that these
            activities not be overlooked as they are an integral part of the college program.Mention
            was made of the fact that new quarters would have to be found for the <placeName type="education">Evening Technical
            Institute.</placeName> </p>
         <p><persName type="attended">Mr. Nick</persName> suggested that the <orgName type="education">Board</orgName> give encouragement to responsible organizations and
            civic groups to use the  <placeName type="education">Behrend College</placeName> facillities.</p>
         <p><persName type="attended">Mr. Nick</persName> asked for a general discussion on the changing of the name of the <placeName type="education">Behrend
            Center.</placeName>. <persName type="attended">Mr. E.L. Keller</persName> suggested that one means might be for the <orgName type="education">Advisory Board</orgName> to
            formally petition the <orgName type="education">Board of Trustees</orgName> of the <placeName type="education">College</placeName> for this change. It was pointed
            out that <q>"Center"</q> was the word used in the agreement between <persName type="absent">Mrs. Behrend</persName> and the
            <orgName type="education">College Trustees</orgName>. At this juncture,<persName type="attended">Mr. Nick</persName> suggested that</p>
         <p>this terminology was only used as a matter of convience,and that <persName type="absent">Mrs. Behrend</persName> definitley
            wanted the name to be <placeName type="education">Behrend College</placeName>,if that was at all possible. Some of the reason
            for changing the name to <q>"College"</q> are: (1) A matter of pride among the students in
            attending a college rather than a Center. (2) There are a number of institutions that
            use the word <q>"Center"</q> in their titles,thus leading to posdible confusion.(3) The natural
            couse of events might well be that the <orgName type="education">Pennsylvania State College</orgName> will become a
            university,in which case <q>"Behrend College"</q> would be a logical name. Other views were
            offfered by members of the <orgName type="education">Board</orgName>.</p>
         <p>It was moved by <persName type="attended">Mr. Fryling</persName> that the Erie branch be called "Behrend College" . This was
            seconded by <persName type="attended">Mr. Carlson</persName> and the motion was passed. It was agreed that the President of
            the <orgName type="education">Advisory Board</orgName> write a letter to the <orgName type="education">Board of Trustees</orgName>  listing these valid reasons
            for this recommendation. It was further suggested that a letter from <persName type="absent">Mrs.Behrend</persName> also be
            sent to the <orgName type="education">Board of Trustees</orgName> on the matter.</p>
         <p>The following night letter was sent to <persName type="absent">President Millholland</persName> that this petition could be
            sent to the <orgName type="education">Board of Trustees</orgName> at their meeting at <placeName type="education">State College</placeName>,Friday,<date when="1948-07-30">July 30th.</date> </p>
         <p><q>"<orgName type="education">ADVISORY BOARD</orgName> AT <placeName type="education">BEHREND CENTER</placeName> AFTER LENGTHY DICUSSION REQUEST CONSIDERATION BE GIVEN
            TO CHANGING NAME OF COLLEGE BRANCH IN <placeName type="city">ERIE</placeName> TO <placeName type="education">BEHREND COLLEGE</placeName> STOP ALL BOARD MEMBERS

               ADVISORY BOARD"</affiliation></q></p>
         <p>A more detailed letter was also to be mailed to <persName type="absent">President Milholland</persName> on this
            matter.(copy attached) </p>
         <p>A general discussion was held on the dedication set for <date when="1948-09-11">September 11,1948</date>,Saturday
            Afternoon.The president of the <orgName type="education">advisory board</orgName> suggested the <persName type="absent">Judge Hirt</persName> be asked to give
            the acceptance speech in the name of the community.This suggestion was made as a motion
            by <persName type="attended">Mr.Zurn</persName> and seconded by <persName type="attended">Mr.Claridge</persName>. It was further suggested that <persName type="absent">Reverend Gearhart</persName>
            be asked to give the opening prayer.It was agreed to send personal invitations to all
            High School Principals in <placeName type="county">Erie County</placeName> and to the Presidents of Colleges in the<placeName type="city">Erie</placeName> 
            area. </p>
         <p><persName type="attended">Mr. Nick</persName> asked <persName type="attended">Mr. Keller</persName> for information on the enrollment for the first semester. <persName type="attended">Mr.
            Keller</persName> stated that there would be at least 150 students and 30 of these will be girls
            who will live on the <placeName type="education">Behrend campus</placeName> in the second floor of the residence.This area will
            be made over into dormitory space. </p>
         <p><persName type="attended">Mr. Robert Reed</persName> suggested that pieces of promotional materials at the plants be made
            available. <persName type="attended">Mr. Allyn Wright</persName> endorsed this heartily.<persName type="attended">Mr.Ferguson</persName> agreed to have this
            material placed in their hands. He will have a quantity printed for use in various
            plants. </p>
         <p>A short discussion was held on the need for pianos at the center. <orgName type="education">The Advisory Board</orgName>
            members were asked to do what they could toward securing these instruments. </p>
