         <p>Memorandum with respect to the desirability of establishing a Junior College
            Center of <placeName ref="PSC">Pennsylvania State College</placeName> in <placeName
               ref="Erie">Erie</placeName>.</p>
         <p>The need for such an institution is shown by a survey rather recently conducted
            under the auspices of Pennsylvania State College among the Seniors and Juniors in our
            Senior High Schools. That survey developed the facts that:</p>
         <list><item n="1">(a) 173 students interviewed plan to go to college but were not interested in a
            Pennslyvania State College Branch in Erie. They had other plans.</item>
         <item n="2">(b) 245 had not planned to go to college, but would be interested if there were a
            Pennslyvania State College Branch here.</item>
         <item n="3">(c) 477 were planning to go to college and wore definintely interested in a
            Pennsylvania State College Branch in Erie.</item></list>
         <p>It should be understood that Pennsylvania State College is not seeking entrance to
            Erie for the purpose of establishing a branch or center here. It has been asked by
            representatives of large and interested groups of Erie people, including the parents of
            hundreds of high school pupils, to bring Erie, as it has brought to four other cities of
            the commonwealth, the benefits of a Junior College, where our young people, both young
            men and young women, may obtain the benefits of two years of an accredited college
            course near at home, from which they can go on to finish in other institutions, or, if
            they are unable to do that, will have had the benefit of two years of advanced study
            beyond the high school cirriculum.</p>
         <p>Pennsylvania State College, a State Institution of high rank, supported by tax
            money, to which all of us contribute, is interested in (1) the need, which appears to be
            demonstrated by the results of the survey above referrod to, and (2) the availability of
            adequate facilities.</p>
         <p>Pennsylvania State College was chartered many years ago to afford instruction in
            the mechanical and agricultural arts. Erie is a growing and increasingly important
            industrial city, surrounded by a rich and productive agricultural area. In the courses
            to be offered in a branch of State College here, emphasis would be placed upon
            engineering, agriculture, chemistry and physics. Incidental, of course, would be
            instruction in mathematics, language, both English and foreign language, which are
            liberal arts courses, which are indispensible in a scientific training. There would
            doubt-less be a limited number of pupils who might be interested only in liberal arts
            courses, who should be taken care of.</p>
         <!-- Was wondering if there was an element that could code the different majors offered-->
         <p>It is apparent, therefore, that with the emphasis on the kind of instruction
            indicated, there will be no duplication of existing facilities for higher eductation in
            Erie.</p>
         <p>Such a branch of Pennsylvania State College would be interested in providing
            courses also in training for community service, in the terminal types of training, such
            as semi-technical training, in medical secretarial work, in sales program and
            accounting, as well as evening adult programs in music, art writing and speaking
            etc.</p>
         <p>Such a project as outlined has been successfully undertaken in four other
            Pennslyvania cities, <placeName ref="Dubois">DuBois</placeName>, <placeName
               ref="Altoona">Altoona</placeName>, <placeName ref="Hazelton">Hazelton</placeName> and
               <placeName ref="Pottsville">Pottsville</placeName>. In all four cities the college
            was afforded the use of presently unused school buildings. In s ome of the cities named
            the buildings have been outgrown and further facilities have been provided by the
            communities for the growing needs of the college. What has been demonstrated to be
            possible and feasible in the cities referred to should be possible of accomplishment in
            Erie.</p>
         <p>It is suggested that a school bulling not presently needed for classroom work,
            such as <placeName ref="MarshallSch">Marshall School</placeName> on East 12th Street,
            might be made available, lease to be made directly with State College, at a nominal
            rental, for a limited period, say five years. The funds necessary to provide necessary
            laboratory and other facilities and properly maintain the building during the lease
            period, would be provided by interested local groups, and those funds have been assured.
            The <orgName ref="SchDst">School District</orgName> need not be called upon for any
            expenditure of money. </p>
         <p>State College recommends the use of an unused school bullding for a limited
            period, (1) to determine how satisfactory the service is, and (2) to find out what
            facilities are going to be needed.</p>
         <p>If satisfactory arrangements can be made with the cooperation of the School
            Board, State College would expect to offer freshman courses for about 200 pupils in
               <time when="1948-09">September</time> of this year, and would bring to Erie a faulty
            of twenty full-time instructors, which would, of course, be increased the second year,
            as these students moved on into the second year and a new freshman class was
            registered.</p>
         <p>Erie needs all the cultural and educational advantages for its young people that
            it is possible to provide. This project presents an opportunity for the expansion of our
            educational facilities which should not be lost, and deserves the most thoughtful and
            careful consideration of our school authorities.</p>
