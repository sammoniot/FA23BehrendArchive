        <h2>Our Project</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to uncover and illuminate the foundation of this esteemed institution by 
            meticulously examining documents dating back to the pivotal years of 1947-1950. In collaboration with 
            the Behrend Lilley Library archives, we have curated a compelling collection of historical artifacts that offer 
            a glimpse into the early days of Penn State Behrend. Our focus spans across five board meetings, three 
            insightful letters, a momentous speech, and a significant memoâ€”all of which hold key insights into the 
            establishment and evolution of this campus.
            As dedicated researchers, we are committed to unraveling the narratives embedded within these documents, 
            seeking to understand the motivations, challenges, and aspirations that shaped Penn State Behrend during 
            its formative years. Join us on this captivating journey through the past, as we piece together the puzzle 
            of our institution's origin and growth.  
            Through our project, we aim to not only preserve the rich history of Penn State Behrend but also to share 
            these discoveries with the broader community. As we navigate the pages of time, we invite you to explore the 
            stories woven into the documents that have played a crucial role in shaping the legacy of our beloved campus.</p>
