        <h3>Our Project</h3>
        <p>For our project we will be taking a look at some of the documents (mostly from 1947-1950)
            that pertain to the founding of Penn State Behrend.These calender sheets are here to
            gain a better understanding of who Mary Behrend was as a person.</p>

        folder as this HTML file we're editing. And we're going into the images folder to deliver the newt-mosaic4.png file inside. -->
