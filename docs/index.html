        <h4>Our Project</h4>
        <p>For our project we will be taking a look at some of the documents (mostly from 1947-1950)
            that pertain to the founding of Penn State Behrend.</p>
        <p>We have compiled a list of documents from the Behrend Library archives that pertain to,in
            some way,the founding of this campus. These include:five board meetings,three
            letters,one speech and one memo.</p>
