                  order. A motion was made and seconded that the minutes of the last meeting not be
                  read.</p>
               <p><span class="persName">Mr. Nick</span> asked <span class="persName">Mr.
                     Ferguson</span> for a general report on all activities today at the <span
                     class="placeName">Center</span>. <span class="persName">Mr. Ferguson</span>
                  gave the details of the building program and pointed out that it was now completed
                  with exceptions of a few minor jobs he added that the money expended to date was
                  an excess of the expected 60,000.00 and when all bills are in a will probably
                  approximate 100,000.00.</p>
               <p>The Administrative Head informed the board the third are 152 credit students and
                  between 80 to 100 evening technical students in attendance at <span
                     class="placeName">Behrend Center</span>. In addition there were also two
                  graduate courses being offered who's enrollment constitutes over 40 local school
                  teachers.</p>
               <p> SOCIAL EVENTS-- for the benefit of those who will not present,-- <span
                     class="persName">Mr. Ferguson</span> briefly outlined the activities that
                  transpired at the</p> formal dedication of Behrend Center. <p> He pointed out that
                  the center was also being used by other groups which is as was originally planned
                  search groups as the <span class="orgName">Erie County Principals
                     Association</span> have held their dinner meetings at the <span
                     class="placeName">center</span> a cello concert was given by a member of the
                  local <span class="orgName">Philharmonic Association</span>. The Faculty held a
                  dinner prior to Christmas Vacation after which an amateur program was put on by
                  the students of the <span class="placeName">Center</span>. The students held their
                  Christmas dance at the<span class="placeName">Masonic Building Ballroom</span>
                  .</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="persName">Mr.Ferguson</span> informed <span class="orgName">the
                     board</span> that the <span class="placeName">Center</span> would be able to
                  take in a few new students in February and at the present there are about 12
                  applications on hand. He further predicted that the fall 1949 enrollment was
                  expected to be around 350 students.</p>
               <p>The new catalog for the fall term would be available about the 1st of March.</p>
               <p>The registration for evening classes, second term, was also discussed by <span
                     class="persName">Mr. Ferguson</span> and he mentioned the fact that it was
                  planned to include a few courses that would be new to the program such as Spanish,
                  Russian and Public Speaking. <span class="orgName">The Board</span> was brought up
                  to date on the work that will be done in a <span class="placeName">Speech
                     Clinic</span> in conjunction with the <span class="orgName">State Office of
                     Rehabilitation</span> and they will also told about the plans to assist the
                     <span class="orgName">Erie Parent Teaches Association</span> in the operation
                  of a Forum.</p>
               <p>GENERAL DISCUSSION ON <span class="persName">MR. FERGUSON'S</span> REMARKS-- <span
                     class="persName">Mr. Nick</span> asked as to the status of new second semester
                  enrollees after having completed this half year's work. <span class="persName">Mr.
                     Ferguson</span> pointed out these students must, upon registration, sign an
                  agreement that they will, through attending <span class="placeName">summer
                     school</span>, prepare themselves so that they can enter <span
                     class="placeName">school</span> in the fall as a full-fledged sophomore. </p>
               <p>The question was raised as to whether or not present facilities could accommodate
                  the predicted 350 student enrollment for the fall 1949 term. It was pointed out
                  that this was based on the assumption that necessary expansion of present
                  classrooms would be made.</p>
               <p><span class="persName">Mr. Carlson</span> asked what the possibilities were for
                  offering graduate work through the <span class="placeName">Behrend Center
                     facility</span> , particularly for area school teachers. It was indicated that
                  the student that certain persons on the campus or working on this problem with the
                  idea to provide more than the present three credit limit of graduate work for the
                  benefit of some of the Board members it was briefly explained that the present
                  College policy does not permit their recognizing more than three credits towards a
                  master's degree on the <span class="placeName">Penn State campus</span> in spite
                  of the fact that student other colleges will accept more than three extension
                  graduate credits offered by <span class="orgName">Penn State</span> services. It
                  is expected that this three credit limit will be increased in the not too distant
                  future but at present it is not known just how many credits will be allowed.</p>
               <p><span class="persName">Mr. Ferguson</span> then suggested that <span
                     class="persName">Mr. Henzi</span>give <span class="orgName">the Board</span> a
                  report on the recreation and athletic activities carried on at the <span
                     class="placeName">Center</span>. <span class="persName">Mr. Henzi</span> stated
                  that's a program at present was a comparatively modest one, and due in part to the
                  inadequacy of the present facilities and to the fact that we are still much in the
                  process of original organization. The board was told that <span class="persName"
                     >Mr. Marvin Demp</span>, Recreational Director at the <span class="placeName"
                     >Center</span>, was directly in charge of this work and under existing
                  circumstances, was doing an excellent job. The various activities, in addition to
                  the regular required physical education program, are as follows:</p>
               <p>MEN'S ACTIVITIES-- Intramural Basketball, six complete teams. It is planned to
                  pick a representative team from these teams to play other comparable Fresh-men
                  groups at nearby institutions. These games are played in the evening at the <span
                     class="placeName">Lawrence Park High School Gymnasium</span> and also on a
                     <span class="placeName">church gymnasium floor</span></p>
               <p>There are approximately 15 to 20 men students who spend Saturday mornings under
                     <span class="persName">Mr. Demp's</span> direction, in wrestling. It is not
                  expected to have an organized wrestling team at the <span class="placeName"
                     >Center</span> but this group will have gained considerable experience in the
                  event that they are interested in wrestling as a varsity sport once they are
                  admitted to the <span class="placeName">main campus.</span></p>
               <p>The Center operates a bowling league in which over60 persons participate one day a
                  week. The comment was made that this is rather exceptional since it represents a
                  little better than half of the student body. The participants in this activity are
                  both men and women students and also a few of the faculty. It does much towards
                  heightening the general morale of the Center and makes for a better relationship
                  between student and faculty. <span class="persName">Mr. Henzi</span> also gave an
                  outline of the expected winter sports program which includes skiing and ice
                  skating. He told the Board that <span class="persName">Mr. Lamb</span> of the
                     <span class="orgName">Erie Dispatch</span> had donated $100.00 to the ski club.
                  This money will be used to buy the equipment necessary to construct a ski lift. An
                  area has also been prepared for ice skating and water will be run into the
                  prepared pond once freezing weather sets in.</p>
               <p>GIRL'S ACTIVITIES: The girls activities are somewhat limited by equipment and
                  numbers. However, smaller groups have become interested in such sports as archery,
                  golf and horseback riding. The outdoor pool of course is not available most of the
                  time because of the weather. It was used quite extensively doing the short period
                  in which sports could be carried on. </p>
               <p>DISCUSSIONS ON SCHOLARSHIPS:-- <span class="persName">Mr. Ferguson</span>
                  suggested that more scholarships could be used at the <span class="orgName"
                     >Center</span>. He informed the board that approximately 90% of the dropouts
                  the <span class="orgName">center</span> has had to date has been because of
                  financial difficulties. He further suggested that the industrial work scholarship
                  would be good i.e. where a company would guarantee to provide a certain number of
                  work hours in order that a needy student might earn money towards his college
                  expenses. <span class="persName">Mr. Carlson</span> made the statement that he was
                  100% for this but felt the present time was somewhat inopportune for further
                  solicitations. This comment was made in view of the recent ending of a number of
                  heavy and intensive financial drives made in the local community.</p>
               <p><span class="persName">Mrs. Klahr</span> suggested that a loan fund might be set
                  up in order to help deserving students. At this point<span class="persName">Mr.
                     Claridge</span> announced that the Hammermill Trust Fund will have a third
                  scholarship available starting in February. The board received this news with the
                  many expressions of enthusiasm.</p>
               <p><span class="persName">Mrs. Ogden</span> informed the Board that <span
                     class="orgName">The College Women's Club</span> has a Loan Fund for women and
                  that she was sure this would be available for proven deserving cases.<span
                     class="persName">Mr. Ferguson</span> then said the center will be very glad to
                  use this the source if necessary there was some discussion as to operation of this
                  very necessary work and it will suggested that the presently named scholarship
                  committee be changed to the student aid committee this suggestion was put into a
                  form of a motion by <span class="persName">Mr. Fryling</span> and seconded by
                     <span class="persName">Mr. Claridge</span>. Motion was carried. The president
                  of the board was directed to name the members to this reorganized committee at an
                  early date.</p>
               <p>PROPOSED FELLOWSHIP-- <span class="persName">Mr. Nick</span> reported to the board
                  that <span class="persName">Mr. L.G. Meyer</span> of <span class="orgName">PA
                     Meyer and Sons</span> wants to establish a Chair for Merchandising and
                  Retailing at the <span class="orgName">Behrend Center</span>. <span
                     class="persName">Mr. Nick</span> asked both <span class="persName">Mr.
                     Ferguson</span> and <span class="persName">Mr. Campbell</span> what information
                  was available to pass on to <span class="persName">Mr. Meyer</span> as to such
                  matters as cost acceptance by the college and other details concerned in such a
                  move. Mossrs. Ferguson and Campbell both agreed that they would have to have more
                  information before being able to give <span class="persName">Mr.Meyers</span>
                  definite facts. It was decided that these gentlemen would make an appointment to
                     see<span class="persName">Mr.Meyers</span> concerning further details. They
                  would then have to clear through the main campus before final action could be
                  taken on this matter. It was, however, felt that no serious difficulty would be
                  encountered and making this most generous gesture to become a reality. After
                  details have been worked out, a further report will be made to <span
                     class="orgName">The Advisory Board</span>.</p>
               <p>TECHNICAL INSTITUTE PROGRAMS--<span class="PersName">Mr. Campbell</span> told the <span class="orgName">board of Purdue Universities Cooperative program</span>
                  with the <span class="orgName">Inland Steel Corporation</span> in which workers from this company
                  went to <span class="orgName">school</span> one day a week and took technical institute type subjects. These courses
                  are not college credit courses but are generally college level and their content. They
                  are much more specific and their objectives and give the individual information on a
                  particular job rather than the general background of knowledge we received in a complete
                  four year college program. This work is taken with the company paying the expenses of
                  the students. <span class="persName">Mr. Campbell</span> was interested in knowing whether the <span class="orgName">board</span> felt that such a
                  program might be of interest to local industries. It was decided that <span class="persName">Mr. Fryling</span> who is
                  presently the <span class="affiliation">president</span> of the <span class="orgName">Manufacturers' Association Board</span><span class="affiliation">> would determine if this
                  group is interested in such a project. If the <span class="orgName"> Association Board</span> so decided <span class="persName">Mr. N.A. Hedden</span>
                     will come to <span class="placeName">Erie</span> to give them more details of this program.</p>
               <p><span class="persName">Mr. Ferguson</span> asked for the Board's opinion on industrial plants registratiors for
                  Evening Technical Institute Classes he pointed out that this was to be done at the
                  <span class="orgName">General Electric Plant</span>  the way the plan would operate would be for a company to announce
                  that on a certain day, at a certain time, representatives from the <span class="placeName"> Center</span> would be
                  available to the company employees to furnish information on the evening classes and
                  also to take registrations for enrollment in these courses. <span class="PersName">Mr.Fryling</span> agreed to also
                  check this matter with the <span class="orgName"> Manufacturers' Association</span> and pass their reaction onto the
                  Board. <span class="PersName">Mr. Campbell</span> informed the board that the <span class="orgName"> Erie Technical Institute</span> was at present
                  one of the smallest in the state and he was of the opinion that a community the size of
                  <span class="placeName"> Erie</span>> , whether it's diversified industries, should have more people involved in this type
                  of training.</p>
               <p>PROPOSED TWO-YEAR COLLEGE CREDIT SECRETERIAL COURSES--<span class="PersName">Mr. Ferguson</span> asked the advice of
                  the <span class="orgName"> Board</span> regarding a proposed two-year secretarial course to be given at the <span class="placeName"> type="education">Behrend Center.</span>></p>
               <p> Mr. Ferguson's primary concern was asked to whether or not local business
                  colleges would object to the inauguration of this course. This question was best
                  answered by expressions to from members of the board that in spite of local secretarial
                  training available they invariably had to give training to new office employees before
                  such persons were deemed competent to carry on the company's business. <span class="orgName"> The Board</span> was
                  definitely in favor of such a course of study being offered at the <span class="placeName"> Center</span>. Mr. Ferguson
                  made the remark that objection might be overruled by the fact that our facilities would
                  limit the number of enrollees to approximately <span class="num">50</num> students. This program of study has to
                  receive the college Senate approval to become official but this action is expected at
                  the next meeting of this group.</p>
               <p>FUTURE BUILDING PLANS-- <span class="PersName">Mr. S.H. Campbell</span> from <span class="affiliation">the College campus in charge of community services</span>
                  was asked to present a suggested plan for a new building to the <span class="orgName"> Board</span>.<span class="persName>Mr.Campbell</span> 
                  did this by giving a brief history of the recent action taken at the <span class="placeName"> Hazleton Center</span>
                  on a very similar structure. All of the members present was shown a blueprint of
                  a proposed recreational building for the <span class="placeName"> Behrend Center</span>. <span class="persName">Mr. Campbell</span> pointed out that
                  this was a necessary facility toward the completeness of any <span class="placeName"> college campus</span> and that it
                  was used for many more things than sports activities. He pointed out such groups as
                  dramatics, musical organizations, assemblies of any large size all needed such an area
                  to carry on the programs. He further stated that it was hoped to introduce, in the not
                  far distant future, an <span class="orgName"> ROTC</span> unit for the <span class="placeName">Behrend Center</span> but that this would be
                  impossible until it could be proven to the military authorities that an adequate place
                  for indoor drill was available. Such a recreation building as this would serve that
                  purpose admirably.</p>
               <span class="milestone">
               <p><span class="PersName">Mr. Campbell</span> was asked what the estimated cost of this building might be and his reply
                  was to the effect that approximately <span class="dollars">$75,000.00</span> would be necessary. There was then a
                  general discussion on whether or not the <span class="orgName"> board</span> would want to get a <span class="orgName"> community organization</span>
                  or organizations to sponsor a drive for funds to erect such a building. It
                  was the general consensus of opinion that if this be done it would be better if a group
                  of organizations sponsored the move. It was felt that the <span class="orgName"> board</span> as such would not direct
                  this drive but would attempt to interest <span class="orgName">local community organizations</span> to take the lead
                  in this work.</p>
               <p><span class="PersName">Mr. Carlson</span> offered a motion that a committee the appointed to contact such
                  organizations to ascertain their interest in a conducting such a drive as described
                  above. This was seconded by <span class="PersName">Mr. Zurn</span> and the motion was carried. This <span class="orgName"> committee</span> will be
                  appointed by the President of the <span class="orgName"> Board</span>.</p>
               <p>The President of the Board suggested that this group go on record in a message of
                  condolence to the family of <span class="PersName">Mr. J. Elmer Reed</span>, whose very recent death was such a loss
                  to the <span class="orgName"> board</span> and the community. <span class="persName">Mr. W Pitt Gifford</span> moved that such an expression be made
                  for the <span class="orgName"> Behrend Center Advisory Board</span> to the Reed family. This was seconded by <span class="persName>Mrs.Klahr</span>
                  the motion was carried <span class="PersName">Mr. Nick</span> appointed <span class="PersName">Mr. Claridge</span> as a Chairman and <span class="PersName">Mr.Gifford</span>
                  and <span class="persName>Mr. Ferguson</span> as the members to carry this motion. (Note:) a copy of the
                  above mentioned resolution was attached to each set of minutes which was sent to the
                  members.</p>
               <p>ADJOURNMENT--A motion was offered to adjourn the meeting. It was moved, seconded and
                  carried. The meeting ended at <time type="evening">5:45 p.m.</time></p>
               <p>Respectfully submitted</p>
               <p><<span class="PersName">R.C. Henzi</span></p>
