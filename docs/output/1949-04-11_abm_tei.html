            in which Mr. E. L. Kollor and Mrs. Behrend, and others took part on how tho college
            might receive a scholarship. It was sug- gestod that approximatoly $400.00 is nocossary

            tho

         <p>To dato thoro has not boon official Sonato action on tho proposod two your socrotorial
            courso. It is oxpoctod that this notion will bo forthooming so that this courso of
            study
            may bo offorod at tho Contor in tho Fall of 1949</p>
         
         <p>As a mombor of tho Committoo on funds for a Rocroation Hall, Mr. Rood roportod that
            ho
            and Mr • Claridgo and Mr. Knobloch had mot sovoral timos. Among tho things that thoy
            discussod and folt should bo rocommondod woro a long range plan for a building layout
            on
            tho campus. The Committeo wants holp from tho Collogo in making such a gonoral layoute
            It was folt that work should bo dono first on that building most noodod immodiatoly.
            It
            was suggostod that funds might bost bo raisod by tho Alumni Association of Tho
            Ponnsylvonia Stato Collogo in Erio. With this in mind, Mr. Othmar Wuonschol, Prosidont
            of tho Alunni Association was askod to sit in on tho mooting. At this point Mr.
            Muonschol romarkod that he plannod to call togothor somo of tho key mombors of tho
            Alumni Association, following tho closo of this Advisory Board Mooting, sinco ho would
            thon bo in possossion of additional facts. Ho furthor suggost- od that in order to
            put
            such a campaign ovor it might bo woll to havo somo at- tractive skotchos and layouts
            of
            tho proposod building to show to prospoctive contributors.</p>
         
         <p>Mr. Rood stated that ho did not fool it nocossary that a high pressure cam- paign
            bo put
            on in ordor to raiso this monoy. Mr. Kollor suggostod that tho Rocroation Building
            would
            be an oxcollent projoct for tho idvisory Board sincc the Collego must nocossorily
            bo
            first and primarily concorned with adoquato facilities for study. Ho motioned
            spocifically additional noods in the scionce Building. His basis for this romark was
            tho
            anticipation of approximatoly 300 studonts for tho Fall of 1949 which is doublo thoso
            hero prosontly; and, also, the possibility within tho noxt yeor or two of tho addition
            of a sophomoro class. Ho furthor statod that the Collogo will go to work on a plot
            plan
            for a long range building program.</p>
         
         <p>Mr.Keller informed tho Board tho collego has spent $113,000.00 to date on the Bohrond
            Contor and expocts to invost anothor $40,000,00 for this Fall It was statod that the
            possibilities at Bohrend Centor scomed groator than thoso at other Contors and,
            thoroforo, moro funds must be allocated. Mrs. Bohr ond told the Board that sho had
            rocontly visited the Architocts at Phil- adolphia who built tho prosontly namod Behrond
            Contor. Sho suggested that porhaps this architect might be all right for such a plonning
            progrom.. Mrs. Bohrond folt that the Ponnsylvania Dutch stylo of architecture ought
            to
            be maintainod throughout in any additions that would be mado, At this point Mr Koller
            told Mrs. Behrond and othor mombors of tho Board, that in any evont all such plans
            would
            havo to bo passod on by tho Colloge architects, Mrs. Bohrond thon made the vory gonorous
            offor of $1000.00 if such financial aid would bo nocossary in order to get the projoct
            of a campus plan underway. Mr, E, Le Koller, for the Colloge, and Mr. Rood for the
            Board, both oxprossod their approciation at this offer. Dotails of this matter have
            to
            bo workod out in tho noar future.</p>
         
         <p>Mr. Koller was asked to givo an ostimato on the cost of tho Rocreation Building and
            ho
            offored tho figuro of $75,000,00 as a minimum, Such a build- ing would bo availablo
            for
            the ontiro community and not just tho Conter. Mr, Knobloch suggested that in the dosign
            of this building the thought bo kopt in mind for future oxpansion. Mr. Kollor addod
            that
            tho Rocroation Building location must of nocossity be docidod by available playing
            fiold
            space and what the drainago program might be. Mr. Rood asked Mr. Ferguson to toll
            tho
            Board the amount that was sot up for noxt your's budgot. Mr. Forguson's answor was
            that
            $245,000.00 had boon allottod.</p>
         
         <p>Mr. Forguson statod that over 150 applications are at present out in the hands of
            possiblo froshmon students. It was of interest to know from Mr. Keller's remark that
            as
            of tho ond of March tho Colloge has roceivod ovor 5,000 applications for ontranco
            in tho
            Freshman Class, This represents 1,000 more than applied last year. Mr. Reed made the
            statement that he believed a large number of local students will be enrolled at Behrend
            Center in September 1949.</p>
         
         <p>Mr. Ferguson reported that Mrs. Behrend had very graciously loaned three paintings
            to
            the Conter to be hung on our, at present, somewhat bare walls.</p>
         
         <p>The Board receivod with much interest, the information from Mr. Ferguson that the
            Student Council had inaugurated a survey of students and parents to determine the
            number
            who would like to return to Behrend Center next year for their Sophomore work.</p>
         
         <p>The Student Council has sent cards to local alumni asking for donations of books for
            the
            Library. The returns on this request have been gratifying.</p>
         
         <p>Mrs. Behrend informed the Board that she would like to refurnish the present library
            room with some pieces of furniture that belonged to Mr. Behrend personally and are
            now
            in the Hammermill Paper Company offices. This could be done since suggested plans
            for
            additional facilities this Fall include the moving of the present library to the
            classroom building. Mr. Keller pointed out that emphasis would be placed on providing
            the Behrend Center library with a number of scientific volumes that would be of value
            to
            industry, as woll as the students; It is hoped that local industry can be acquainted
            with the material the library will possess so that they may make use of it during
            the
            evenings.</p>
         
         <p>1 motion was made and secondod for adjournmont at 2:05 p. m.</p> 
         <p>Respectfully submitted
