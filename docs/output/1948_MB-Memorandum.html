               <p>Memorandum with respect to the desirability of establishing a Junior College
                  Center of <span class="placeName">Pennsylvania State College</span> in <span class="placeName">Erie</span>.</p>
               
               <p>The need for such an institution is shown by a survey rather recently conducted
                  under the auspices of Pennsylvania State College among the Seniors and Juniors in
                  our
                  Senior High Schools. That survey developed the facts that:</p>
               (a) 173 students interviewed plan to go to college but were not interested in a
               Pennslyvania State College Branch in Erie. They had other plans.
               (b) 245 had not planned to go to college, but would be interested if there were a
               Pennslyvania State College Branch here.
               (c) 477 were planning to go to college and wore definintely interested in a
               Pennsylvania State College Branch in Erie.
               
               <p>It should be understood that Pennsylvania State College is not seeking entrance to
                  Erie for the purpose of establishing a branch or center here. It has been asked by
                  representatives of large and interested groups of Erie people, including the parents
                  of
                  hundreds of high school pupils, to bring Erie, as it has brought to four other cities
                  of
                  the commonwealth, the benefits of a Junior College, where our young people, both young
                  men and young women, may obtain the benefits of two years of an accredited college
                  course near at home, from which they can go on to finish in other institutions, or,
                  if
                  they are unable to do that, will have had the benefit of two years of advanced study
                  beyond the high school cirriculum.</p>
               
               <p>Pennsylvania State College, a State Institution of high rank, supported by tax
                  money, to which all of us contribute, is interested in (1) the need, which appears
                  to be
                  demonstrated by the results of the survey above referrod to, and (2) the availability
                  of
                  adequate facilities.</p>
               
               <p>Pennsylvania State College was chartered many years ago to afford instruction in
                  the mechanical and agricultural arts. Erie is a growing and increasingly important
                  industrial city, surrounded by a rich and productive agricultural area. In the courses
                  to be offered in a branch of State College here, emphasis would be placed upon
                  engineering, agriculture, chemistry and physics. Incidental, of course, would be
                  instruction in mathematics, language, both English and foreign language, which are
                  liberal arts courses, which are indispensible in a scientific training. There would
                  doubt-less be a limited number of pupils who might be interested only in liberal arts
                  courses, who should be taken care of.</p>
               
               
               <p>It is apparent, therefore, that with the emphasis on the kind of instruction
                  indicated, there will be no duplication of existing facilities for higher eductation
                  in
                  Erie.</p>
               
               <p>Such a branch of Pennsylvania State College would be interested in providing
                  courses also in training for community service, in the terminal types of training,
                  such
                  as semi-technical training, in medical secretarial work, in sales program and
                  accounting, as well as evening adult programs in music, art writing and speaking
                  etc.</p>
               
               <p>Such a project as outlined has been successfully undertaken in four other
                  Pennslyvania cities, <span class="placeName">DuBois</span>, <span class="placeName">Altoona</span>, <span class="placeName">Hazelton</span> and
                  <span class="placeName">Pottsville</span>. In all four cities the college
                  was afforded the use of presently unused school buildings. In s ome of the cities
                  named
                  the buildings have been outgrown and further facilities have been provided by the
                  communities for the growing needs of the college. What has been demonstrated to be
                  possible and feasible in the cities referred to should be possible of accomplishment
                  in
                  Erie.</p>
               
               <p>It is suggested that a school bulling not presently needed for classroom work,
                  such as <span class="placeName">Marshall School</span> on East 12th Street,
                  might be made available, lease to be made directly with State College, at a nominal
                  rental, for a limited period, say five years. The funds necessary to provide necessary
                  laboratory and other facilities and properly maintain the building during the lease
                  period, would be provided by interested local groups, and those funds have been assured.
                  The <span class="orgName">School District</span> need not be called upon for any
                  expenditure of money. </p>
               
               <p>State College recommends the use of an unused school bullding for a limited
                  period, (1) to determine how satisfactory the service is, and (2) to find out what
                  facilities are going to be needed.</p>
               
               <p>If satisfactory arrangements can be made with the cooperation of the School
                  Board, State College would expect to offer freshman courses for about 200 pupils in
                  September of this year, and would bring to Erie a faulty
                  of twenty full-time instructors, which would, of course, be increased the second year,
                  as these students moved on into the second year and a new freshman class was
                  registered.</p>
               
               <p>Erie needs all the cultural and educational advantages for its young people that
                  it is possible to provide. This project presents an opportunity for the expansion
                  of our
                  educational facilities which should not be lost, and deserves the most thoughtful
                  and
                  careful consideration of our school authorities.</p>
