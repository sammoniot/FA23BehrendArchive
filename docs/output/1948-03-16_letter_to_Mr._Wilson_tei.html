               <p>Dear <span class="persName">Mr. Wilson</span>: Study-Demand for Personnel at Post-High School
                  Level I am assisting <span class="persName">Dr. George A. Works</span>,Director Post
                  High-School,in connection with the study he is making of the demand for
                  scientific </p>
               
               <p>and technical personnel in the fields of engineering and in the areas commonly referred
                  to as Technical Institutes. This study is the result of an Act passed in July 1947 by the <span class="orgName">General Assembly of
                     the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania</span> authorizing 
                  <span class="orgName">The Joint State Government Commission</span> to study personnel needs of different types. You
                  can aid me in this study by furnishing me the following information:</p>
               
               How many people does your industry employ?
               
               What percentage of your employees may be classed as working in technical
               occupations?
               Of your employees in technical occupations how many are engineers with a college
               degree in engineering or the equivalent?
               4. Of your employees in technical occupations, how many are in occupations auxiliary
               to
               engineering, such as draftsman, testers, inspectors, technicians, and similar categories
               which ordinarily require these so-called Technical Institute type of preparation? That is,
               employees in the same areas between the skilled crafts and engineering.
               Of the engineers employed by your organization, what percentage are graduates from
               Pennsylvania engineering colleges?
               Do you feel that the engineering output of Pennsylvania colleges should be increased?
               If so, should additional engineering college facilities be made available by increasing
               the facilities of the present institutions,  by adding new institutions, 
               or by encouraging more of the existing <span class="placeName">Pennsylvania</span> College
               not now offering engineering to start engineering programs of study? 
               Are the facilities in <span class="placeName">Pennsylvania</span> adequate to meet the needs for technical employees
               in the area between the skilled Ccaftsman and are engineers? If not, what facilities
               should be made available in <span class="placeName">Pennsylvania</span> for the so-called Technical Institute type of
               education? Where should such additional technical institutes be located?
               
               
               
               
               
               <p>I am taking the liberty of writing to you and to other leaders in <span class="placeName">Pennsylvania</span> industry
                  and shall appreciate a reply to any of the questions about also any other information
                  which may prove helpful to me an appraising in the adequacy of the facilities in
                  <span class="placeName">Pennsylvania</span>  to meet the needs of industry for engineering personnel and for those with
                  the technical institute type of preparation</p>
