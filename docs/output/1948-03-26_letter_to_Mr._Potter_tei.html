               <p>Dear <span class="persName">Dr Potter</span>:--</p>
               
               <p>in reply to your March 16th 1948 letter addressed to <span class="persName">Mr. G. W. Wilson</span> it is apparent
                  that you desire accurate information as it might apply to our company as a whole
                  therefore since this information is directly available through the office of <span class="persName">Mr. M.M.
                     Boring</span> at <span class="orgName">Schenectady</span> your inquiry is being forwarded to him for reply.</p>
               
               <p>For your information, <span class="orgName">Pennsylvania State College</span> is at present being petitioned to
                  establish an undergraduate Center in <span class="placeName">Erie PA</span> to provide the initial to use of accredited
                  college study to those interested in  engineering, science and agriculture. Despite
                  opposition voiced by three local colleges namely <span class="orgName"> Mercyhurst</span>, and <span class="orgName">Villa Maria (girls
                     college)</span>,and <span class="orgName">Gannon college</span>   (offering Liberal Arts courses), it has been determined
                  through a carefully conducted survey in cooperation with <span class="orgName">Penn State College</span> Extension
                  Services that there is a definite need for such a Center in this area we understand
                  that
                  the matter is to be discussed with the <span class="orgName">Penn State</span> Trustees during the coming week, and
                  for the benefit of this largely Industrial community, we trust that a favorable decision
                  to establish that you sent to you will be made.</p>
               
               <p>It would be far preferable to the people of this community as a whole to establish
                  such
                  a branch of <span class="orgName">Penn State College</span> which is thoroly competent to provide high standard
                  instruction in these specialized subjects, rather than an attempt to add an engineering
                  curriculum to the college above-mentioned.</p>
               
               <p>Fall particularly may be secured from <span class="persName">Mr. David E. Pugh</span> of Pennsylvania State College
                  who has spent considerable time in this area studying the entire situation.</p>
               
               <p>Yours very truly,</p>
               
               <p>(Signed)<span class="persName">R.C.Reed</span> </p>
