               <p>Dear Dr Potter:--</p>
               
               <p>in reply to your March 16th 1948 letter addressed to Mr. G. W. Wilson it is apparent
                  that you desire accurate information as it might apply to our company as a whole
                  therefore since this information is directly available through the office of Mr. M.M.
                  Boring at Schenectady your inquiry is being forwarded to him for reply.</p>
               
               <p>For your information, Pennsylvania State College is at present being petitioned to
                  establish an undergraduate Center in Erie PA to provide the initial to use of accredited
                  college study to those interested in  engineering, science and agriculture. Despite
                  opposition voiced by three local colleges namely  Mercyhurst, and Villa Maria (girls
                  college),and Gannon college   (offering Liberal Arts courses), it has been determined
                  through a carefully conducted survey in cooperation with Penn State College Extension
                  Services that there is a definite need for such a Center in this area we understand
                  that
                  the matter is to be discussed with the Penn State Trustees during the coming week, and
                  for the benefit of this largely Industrial community, we trust that a favorable decision
                  to establish that you sent to you will be made.</p>
               
               <p>It would be far preferable to the people of this community as a whole to establish
                  such
                  a branch of Penn State College which is thoroly competent to provide high standard
                  instruction in these specialized subjects, rather than an attempt to add an engineering
                  curriculum to the college above-mentioned.</p>
               
               <p>Fall particularly may be secured from Mr. David E. Pugh of Pennsylvania State College
                  who has spent considerable time in this area studying the entire situation.</p>
               
               <p>Yours very truly,</p>
               
               <p>(Signed)R.C.Reed </p>
