               <strong>TALK GIVEN BY MRS. BEHREND AT THE DEDICATION OF BEHREND CENTER OCTOBER 30,
                  1948</strong>

               <p><span class="persName">President Milholland</span>,<span class="persName">Dr.
                     Keller</span>, <span class="persName">Mr. Ferguson</span>, Members of the
                  various boards of Behrend Center, Students and Guests:</p>

               <p>This day of the dedication is a very important one for both my daughter and
                  myself. We often have had in mind aver since we were left with <span
                     class="placeName">Glenhill Farm</span> that it should be used if at all
                  possible for a school or some place of some educational purpose. Over a number of
                  years I tried to accomplish this. It could have been sold for a gambling place, a
                  development program, several low offers came for a residence site (usually with
                  the plan to divide it in one way or another.)</p>

               <p>Last spring, when I returned from California, I stopped off in <span
                     class="placeName">Erie</span> and saw several protects. While in the midst of
                  this here at the farm, I noticed, two visitors walking along over by the pool. So
                  I went out and said to them, "I am Mrs. Behrend. Can I do anything for you?" <span
                     class="persName"></span> and <span class="persName"></span> presented
                  themselves and Dr. Keller said they were looking around for a spot to locate an
                  Erie center for Pennsylvania State College. I took them all around the place. Dr.
                  Keller knew what was needed and his questions and remarks were very much to the
                  point. After an hour, he asked if he could call up State College. Then things
                  moved along. I went back East knowing that Pennsylvania State College wanted to
                  buy the farm. It seemed so very right that it should be used in connection with an
                  established college.</p>

               <p>There were details to be worked out, there were numerous long distance calls with
                  my lawyer, <span class="persName">Mr. Gifford</span>, in Erie. What impressed me
                  was the fact that State College wanted it enough to buy it, to endeavor to raise a
                  goodly amount on top of what they could pay--quite a program. They thought well
                  enough of it to want to buy it.</p>

               <p>After several days, I said to my daughter, "I think this is something that would
                  be a wonderful memorial to Father--something he almost could have planned himself.
                  I think I should give it all to the college.</p>

               <p>And that is how it came about.</p>

               <p>Looking back over many years, I know I was able to make two important and very
                  right decisions. The first in 1907 when I consented to marry Ernst Behrend. The
                  second decision was, as you may guess, to make this outright gift to Pennsylvania
                  State College of Glenhill Farm as a memorial to my husband. It is just 50 years
                  since the ground was broken for the Hammermill Paper Company.</p>

               <p>It seems suitable that such a memorial should be maintained in Erie. <span
                     class="persName">Ernst Behrend</span> did not only head the Hammermill Paper
                  Company, but had time for various civic duties and was active on several boards in
                  this city. He was president to the <span class="placeName"></span> for several
                  years. These duties he took seriously as indeed he did his citizenship. He tried
                  to put his best into whatever he undertook.</p>

               <p>Everyone connected with the Center has been kind and considerate and, what pleases
                  me so much, so appreciative of the beauty of the build- ings and the surroundings.
                  It is gratifying to observe the care with which all details have been worked out
                  in accordance with the architect's original work. And the use which has been made
                  of all spaces is little short amazing. I am sure had there been any hen houses and
                  large dog kennels, Mr. Ferguson would have had them enlarged a bit and some
                  members of the faculty would now be living in them. Maybe not with twins but just
                  couples!</p>

               <p>I want to express my thanks to the editors of the Nittinay Cub, the Center's
                  publication, for the very nice article about me which they printed. The magazine
                  is cleverly figured out and I congratulate them I used to publish a small magazine
                  many years ago, the Grasshopper, 250 Only to say I still love the smell of
                  printers' ink and beleive I could soon catch on to setting type once more.</p>

               <p>I would like to shake hands with <span class="persName">Grace Burt</span> and
                     <span class="persName">Donald Bebko</span>, the first young people from the
                  Hammermill to take the courses at Behrend Center</p>

               <p>When I first visited Erie back in 1905 and 1906, I met Ernst Behrend. I came out
                  to visit <span class="persName">Maud Carter</span> (now Mrs. Shannon and head of
                  the <span class="orgName">Red Cross</span>) and I am happy she is here today. She
                  will remember that just before the first dinner party the men we were to meet were
                  being described to us and I was asked by whom would you like to sit? And I
                  replied, "I think I would like to sit beside the paper man-he seems the nicest, "
                  and he was.</p>

               <p>During these visits, I met his parents. They came in those days every summer and
                  spent three months in Erie. <span class="persName">Mrs. William Brust</span>, a
                  sister now living in Erie, always came with them. Mrs. Brust, I am happy to say is
                  here today.</p>

               <p>The Mother was a dependable and lovely person and made many friends in <span
                     class="placeName">Erie</span>. The Father was one of the most interesting men I
                  have ever met. Not particularly tall, with a shock of snow white hair, and fine
                  intelligent face, he presented an appearance not to be forgotten. His mind was
                  keen. His manner of unfolding a problem always fascinated me--even if I did not
                  entirely understand what it would be all about--I would always listen with rapt
                  attention. He never seemed to use an extra word, each sentence was a definite part
                  of the whole. And then he had a loveable and whimsical way of tucking in little
                  jokes and there would be a twinkle in his eye!</p>

               <p>These parents of <span class="persName">Ernst Behrend</span> were a dependable
                  factor when it came to making my decision to leave my family, relatives in New
                  England, and "go west.</p>

               <p>During the first years of our married life, we lived almost in the mill yard with
                  the switching engines snorting past the front porch. Interesting years-visitors
                  from all over the world it seemed: <span class="placeName">Norway</span>, <span
                     class="placeName">Sweden</span>, <span class="placeName">England</span>, <span
                     class="placeName">Germany</span>, <span class="placeName">Austria</span>, <span
                     class="placeName">the Argentine</span>, <span class="placeName">Brazil</span>,
                  etc., etc.</p>

               <p>When our two children were old enough to travel they accompanied us on our cruises
                  and tours--twice around the world and to the West Indies several times, South
                  America and so on.</p>

               <p>Wherever we went <span class="orgName">Hammermill</span> agents always welcomed us
                  and, while we may have missed many sights while being entertained by these kindly
                  people, we did make many good friends. To some of these I' have recently mailed
                  newspaper clippings about this memorial to Ernst Behrend in Erie and have had
                  wonderful letters in return.</p>

               <p>My husband, like his Father, had a pleasant, cheery way of meet- ing people and
                  the same little twinkle in his eye. Few people today seem to have twinkles--we
                  need more in this battered up old world.</p>

               <p>Many things happened--I cannot talk about it all. But there came a time in our
                  lives when we were sad and bewildered. It was then that we bought this farm and
                  over the years built up the place more or less as you see it today. <span
                     class="persName">Mr. J. C. Ainsworth</span>, who many of you will remember as
                  the head of the physical department at the Y.M.C.A., took us first to see the
                  location. We came out here often and had picnics. We used to take long walks
                  through the woods and later had some western ponies we rode. There were always
                  many dogs--we both liked them. (I am glad there are dogs here now.) Many happy
                  years were spent at <span class="placeName"></span>. We three loved it all</p>

               <p>My husband always had time to talk with young people and to be of help to them to
                  the best of his ability. I remember hearing him say more than once that it meant
                  more to him to feel that young people were making good in the mills than to read
                  balance sheets with profit figures. No matter how busy he was, there was always
                  time in his day to listen to the problems young people would bring to him.</p>

               <p>I feel grateful that the opportunity to make this gift came exactly as it did. It
                  will further one of his greatest interests- education--to be carried on where
                  loved best to be-Glenhill Farm.</p>

               <p>"It is pleasant to feel that, over the years to come, many young men and women
                  will go forth from this lovely spot well equipped from with the instruction
                  education they have received" at the <span class="placeName">Behrend Center of the
                     Pennsylvania State College</span>. </p>

               <p>Thank you.</p>
