                  accept the minutes was made by Mr. Claridge and seconded by Mr.Zurn.</p>
               
               <p>Mr. Nick asked the Secretary to mail the minutes of all future meetings to each member
                  of the Board.</p>
               
               <p>Mr. Nick asked Mr. Ferguson,Administrative Head,for a resume of the general situation
                  at
                  the Behrend Center.Mr. Ferguson covered the construction work to date and stated that
                  the work is ahead of scheduele. Mr. Ferguson also brought the Advisory Board members
                  up-to-date on the staff members appointed.</p>
               
               <p>On the matter of publicity,Mr.Ferguson commended the action of some companies in
                  publicizing Behrend College in their company publications. He also stated that both
                  of
                  the local newspapers have been very cooperative.He talked briefly about concerning
                  the
                  Daytime technical Institute and Evening Technical Institute and cautioned that these
                  activities not be overlooked as they are an integral part of the college program.Mention
                  was made of the fact that new quarters would have to be found for the Evening Technical
                  Institute. </p>
               
               <p>Mr. Nick suggested that the Board give encouragement to responsible organizations
                  and
                  civic groups to use the Behrend College facillities.</p>
               
               <p>Mr. Nick asked for a general discussion on the changing of the name of the Behrend
                  Center.Mr. E.L. Keller suggested that one means might be for the Advisory Board to
                  formally petition the Board of Trustees of the College for this change. It was pointed
                  out that "Center" was the word used in the agreement between Mrs. Behrend and the
                  College Trustees. At this juncture,Mr. Nick suggested that</p>
               
               <p>this terminology was only used as a matter of convience,and that Mrs. Behrend definitley
                  wanted the name to be Behrend College,if that was at all possible. Some of the reason
                  for changing the name to "College" are: (1) A matter of pride among the students in
                  attending a college rather than a Center. (2) There are a number of institutions that
                  use the word "Center" in their titles,thus leading to posdible confusion.(3) The natural
                  couse of events might well be that the Pennsylvania State College will become a
                  university,in which case "Behrend College" would be a logical name. Other views were
                  offfered by members of the Board.</p>
               
               <p>It was moved by Mr. Fryling that the Erie branch be called "Behrend College" . This
                  was
                  seconded by Mr. Carlson and the motion was passed. It was agreed that the President
                  of
                  the Advisory Board write a letter to the Board of Trustees listing these valid reasons
                  for this recommendation. It was further suggested that a letter from Mrs.Behrend also
                  be
                  sent to the Board of Trustees on the matter.</p>
               
               <p>The following night letter was sent to President Millholland that this petition could
                  be
                  sent to the Board of Trustees at their meeting at State College,Friday,July 30th.

                  matter.(copy attached) </p>
               
               <p>A general discussion was held on the dedication set for September 11,1948,Saturday
                  Afternoon.The president of the advisory board suggested the Judge Hirt be asked to
                  give
                  the acceptance speech in the name of the community.This suggestion was made as a motion
                  by Mr.Zurn and seconded by Mr.Claridge. It was further suggested that Reverend Gearhart
                  be asked to give the opening prayer.It was agreed to send personal invitations to
                  all
                  High School Principals in Erie County and to the Presidents of Colleges in the Erie
                  area. </p>
               
               <p>Mr. Nick asked Mr. Keller for information on the enrollment for the first semester.Mr.
                  Keller stated that there would be at least 150 students and 30 of these will be girls
                  who will live on the Behrend campus in the second floor of the residence.This area
                  will
                  be made over into dormitory space. </p>
               
               <p>Mr. Robert Reed suggested that pieces of promotional materials at the plants be made
                  available.Mr. Allyn Wright endorsed this heartily.Mr.Ferguson agreed to have this
                  material placed in theirhands. He will have a quantity printed for use in various
                  plants. </p>
               
               <p>A short discussion was held on the need for pianos at the center. The Advisory Board
                  members were asked to do what they could toward securing these instruments. </p>
               
               <p>The meeting adjourned at 5:25 P.M.</p>
