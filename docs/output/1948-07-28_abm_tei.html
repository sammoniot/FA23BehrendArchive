               <p><span class="persName">Mr. Nick</span> asked the Secretary to mail the minutes of all future meetings to each member
                  of the Board.</p>
               <p><span class="persName">Mr. Nick</span> asked <span class="persName">Mr. Ferguson</span>,<span class="affiliation">Administrative Head</span>,for a resume of the general situation at
                  the <span class="placeName">Behrend Center</span>>.<span class="persName">Mr. Ferguson</span> covered the construction work to date and stated that
                  the work is ahead of scheduele. <span class="persName">Mr. Ferguson</span> also brought the <span class="orgName">Advisory Board</span> members
                  up-to-date on the staff members appointed.</p>
               <p>On the matter of publicity,<span class="persName">Mr.Ferguson</span> commended the action of some companies in
                  publicizing <span class="placeName">Behrend College</span>> in their company publications. He also stated that both of
                  the local newspapers have been very cooperative.He talked briefly about concerning the
                  <span class="placeName">Daytime technical Institute</span>> and <span class="placeName">Evening Technical Institute</span>> and cautioned that these
                  activities not be overlooked as they are an integral part of the college program.Mention
                  was made of the fact that new quarters would have to be found for the <span class="placeName">Evening Technical
                     Institute.</span>> </p>
               <p><span class="persName">Mr. Nick</span> suggested that the <span class="orgName">Board</span> give encouragement to responsible organizations and
                  civic groups to use the  <span class="placeName">Behrend College</span>> facillities.</p>
               <p><span class="persName">Mr. Nick</span> asked for a general discussion on the changing of the name of the <span class="placeName">Behrend
                  Center.</span>>. <span class="persName">Mr. E.L. Keller</span> suggested that one means might be for the <span class="orgName">Advisory Board</span> to
                  formally petition the <span class="orgName">>Board of Trustees</span> of the <span class="placeName">College</span>> for this change. It was pointed
                  out that <q>"Center"</q> was the word used in the agreement between <span class="persName">Mrs. Behrend</span> and the
                     <span class="orgName">College Trustees</span>. At this juncture,<span class="persName">Mr. Nick</span> suggested that</p>
               <p>this terminology was only used as a matter of convience,and that <span class="persName">Mrs. Behrend</span> definitley
                  wanted the name to be <span class="placeName">Behrend College</span>>,if that was at all possible. Some of the reason
                  for changing the name to <q>"College"</q> are: (1) A matter of pride among the students in
                  attending a college rather than a Center. (2) There are a number of institutions that
                  use the word <q>"Center"</q> in their titles,thus leading to posdible confusion.(3) The natural
                  couse of events might well be that the <span class="orgName">>Pennsylvania State College</span> will become a
                  university,in which case <q>"Behrend College"</q> would be a logical name. Other views were
                     offfered by members of the <span class="orgName">Board</span>.</p>
               <p>It was moved by <span class="persName">Mr. Fryling</span> that the Erie branch be called "Behrend College" . This was
                  seconded by <span class="persName">Mr. Carlson</span> and the motion was passed. It was agreed that the President of
                  the <span class="orgName">Advisory Board</span> write a letter to the <span class="orgName">>Board of Trustees</span>  listing these valid reasons
                  for this recommendation. It was further suggested that a letter from <span class="persName">Mrs.Behrend</span> also be
                     sent to the <span class="orgName">Board of Trustees</span> on the matter.</p>
               <p>The following night letter was sent to <span class="persName">President Millholland</span> that this petition could be
                  sent to the <span class="orgName">Board of Trustees</span> at their meeting at <span class="placeName">State College</span>>,Friday,July 30th. </p>
               <p><q>"<span class="orgName">>ADVISORY BOARD</span> AT <span class="placeName">BEHREND CENTER</span>> AFTER LENGTHY DICUSSION REQUEST CONSIDERATION BE GIVEN

                  Afternoon.The president of the <span class="orgName">advisory board</span> suggested the <span class="persName">Judge Hirt</span> be asked to give

                  by <span class="persName">Mr.Zurn</span> and seconded by <span class="persName">Mr.Claridge</span>. It was further suggested that <span class="persName">Reverend Gearhart</span>
                  be asked to give the opening prayer.It was agreed to send personal invitations to all
                  High School Principals in <span class="placeName">Erie County</span>> and to the Presidents of Colleges in the<span class="placeName">Erie</span>> 
                  area. </p>
               <p><span class="persName">Mr. Nick</span> asked <span class="persName">Mr. Keller</span> for information on the enrollment for the first semester. <span class="persName">Mr.
                  Keller</span> stated that there would be at least 150 students and 30 of these will be girls
                  who will live on the <span class="placeName">Behrend campus</span>> in the second floor of the residence.This area will
                  be made over into dormitory space. </p>
               <p><span class="persName">Mr. Robert Reed</span> suggested that pieces of promotional materials at the plants be made
                  available. <span class="persName">Mr. Allyn Wright</span> endorsed this heartily.<span class="persName">Mr.Ferguson</span> agreed to have this
                  material placed in their hands. He will have a quantity printed for use in various
                  plants. </p>
               <p>A short discussion was held on the need for pianos at the center. <span class="orgName">>The Advisory Board</span>
                  members were asked to do what they could toward securing these instruments. </p>
